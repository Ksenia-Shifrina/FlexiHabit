# FlexiHabit

FlexiHabit is a habit-tracking app designed to help users develop and maintain good habits by providing a clear and customizable interface to track daily progress. Users set goals for how many times a week they want to do a certain activity, mark target days when they want to do them, monitor their progress, and can adjust their target days to fit their schedules.

FlexiHabit is a comprehensive habit tracking web application that was designed and implemented from scratch using React, TypeScript, Material UI, and MongoDB. The project features a clear separation between frontend and backend, utilizing React Router for a seamless multipage experience. 

## Key Features
- **Habit List with Weekly Calendar**: Track habits with a calendar view for the current week, allowing users to mark completed days.
- **Customizable Target Days**: Set and adjust target days to achieve weekly goals and maintain habit streaks.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between past and future weeks to monitor progress over time.
- **Progression Bar**: Visualize weekly habit completion with a progression bar.
- **Minimum Weekly Goal Statements**: Encourage consistency with personalized goal statements for each habit.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Material UI
- Backend: TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- Routing: React Router

## Learning Highlights

- **Frontend-Backend Separation**: Focused on practising the separation of frontend and backend.
- **RESTful API Development**: Gained experience in designing and building **RESTful APIs** to enable smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This included creating endpoints to manage user data and habit progress.
- **Data Structure and Optimisation**: Worked on structuring data to meet project requirements and iterated on designs to optimise data retrieval and updates.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Utilised **MongoDB** to store and manage user data, learning to implement **query filters** and optimise database interactions for performance and reliability.
- **Frontend-Backend Interaction**: Gained experience using **React hooks** to interact with the backend, enabling dynamic data retrieval and updates from the frontend.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Developed a deeper understanding of **full-stack** development by ensuring a seamless connection between the client-side and server-side of the application. This project enhanced my skills in both frontend and backend technologies.


## Future Improvements
- Implement authentication and authorisation to securely track user progress.
- Update database schemas to store client data.
- Develop data visualisation features to represent habit statistics.
- Enhance the UI for better responsiveness on smaller screens.
